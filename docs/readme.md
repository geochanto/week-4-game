# Crystal Game
This is a simple game where player will be given a random number and 4 crystals with hidden values at the start of the game. By clicking on a crystal player find out what is the value of the crystal, and will add this value to their total score.

Game is won by matching the total score to the random number. 

Game is lost when total score exceeds the random number.

Each time when the game starts the game will change the values of the random number and each crystal. Also, total score is reset to zero.
